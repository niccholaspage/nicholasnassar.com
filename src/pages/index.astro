          Passionate, diligent, and detailed. In my eleven years of programming, I have spent my time expanding my
          knowledge in both frontend and backend technologies. Much like Pepper the cat, I am a leader, and I am
          constantly looking for opportunities to advise my collegues. Recently, I've been writing compilers and build
          tools.
